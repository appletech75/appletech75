## how i got into programming and jailbreaking

Mayby your asking yourself how did i get into programming and jailbreaking well its simple ;)
So how did i get into jailbreaking well i was only somthing like 9 or 10 years old and i saw people on youtube talking about jailbreaking so by that i mean what is it, how do you do it and many many more, and that inspired me, and you all know what happens when i get inspired, yes you got it right doing it too so then i waited so long like 1 year or an half and then i got my first phone an iphone 7, and what do you again think what im going to do with that, yes you got it again Jailbreak it but i dint know anything about jailbreaking and i cant jailbreak it bc it was running ios 15 and it was 2021 or begin 2022 but the palra1in jailbreak was not released in that time but then in end 2022 i got an iphone 4s and ipod touch 4g and iphone 6 plus and there was a jailbreak for ios 12, 6 and 9 but also much more but yea thats how i got into jailbreak but now jailbreaking is not my thing anymore, Programing is my thing now.
And now how did i get into programming wel from jailbreak bc i made a cydia repo on github and a website and for that i used html css and javascript and that are programming languages and then i started to make real website and clean so by that i mean modern and professional like the PermissionMaster website and my blog website that is comming soon so this is how i got into programming and jailbreaking thats it have a nice day.
