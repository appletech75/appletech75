## How I Got Into Programming and Jailbreaking

You might be wondering how I got into programming and jailbreaking. Well, it's quite a simple story! 😊

I first discovered jailbreaking when I was around 9 or 10 years old. I saw people talking about it on YouTube, and it piqued my curiosity. I started researching what jailbreaking was, how it worked, and much more. The whole concept inspired me, and you know what happens when I get inspired — I dive right in!

After waiting patiently for about a year and a half, I finally got my hands on my first iPhone 7. And guess what I did? Yes, you're right—I jailbroke it! However, at that time, I had limited knowledge about jailbreaking, and I couldn't jailbreak it because it was running iOS 15, which didn't have a jailbreak available. But my passion for jailbreaking didn't fade away.

In late 2022, I acquired an iPhone 4S, iPod Touch 4G, and iPhone 6 Plus. This time, there were jailbreaks available for iOS 12, 6, 9, and more. I dived into jailbreaking with these devices. However, as time went on, my interest shifted, and now programming has become my primary focus.

So, how did I transition from jailbreaking to programming? It started with my Cydia repo on GitHub and a website, which involved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages are the building blocks of programming. From there, I began creating real websites—clean, modern, and professional, like the PermissionMaster website and my upcoming blog website.

That's how my journey unfolded—how I got into programming and jailbreaking. Thanks for reading, and have a great day! 😄

## Programming Environment

I am using a MacBook Air (mid-2012) running macOS 13.5 beta. You might be wondering how I managed to get macOS running on an unsupported MacBook. Well, I used the OpenCore Legacy Patcher, which allowed me to install macOS on it successfully.

In addition, I also have an iMac from either 2012 or 2014, running macOS 13 (specific Ventura version unknown). The iMac is also set up with the OpenCore Legacy Patcher. However, currently, I don't have access to my iMac, so I bought a used MacBook from the marketplace, which is in great condition.
